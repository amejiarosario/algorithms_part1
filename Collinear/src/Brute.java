/**
 * Brute force. Write a program Brute.java that examines 4 points at a time
 * and checks whether they all lie on the same line segment, printing out any
 * such line segments to standard output and drawing them using standard
 * drawing. To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, check
 * whether the slopes between p and q, between p and r, and between p and s
 * are all equal.
 * 
 * The order of growth of the running time of your program should be N4 in the
 * worst case and it should use space proportional to N.
